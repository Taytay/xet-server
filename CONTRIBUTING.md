# Contributing to Xet Server

Welcome! This guide covers how to set up your environment, run the test
suite, and the conventions this project follows for docs, branches, and
pull requests.

## 1. Setting Up the Development Environment

Clone the repository and verify your toolchain:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> Xet-Server
cd Xet-Server
make pre-check
```

`make pre-check` verifies Go and Bash are present and prints their versions.
This project has **zero external Go dependencies** beyond the standard
library plus `github.com/zeebo/blake3` (a pure-Go BLAKE3 implementation
required for wire compatibility with real Xet hashes) - no proxy config,
no network access needed to build.

Build both binaries:

```bash
make build   # -> bin/xetd (server), bin/xet (CLI)
```

## 2. Running Tests

Three layers of tests exist; run all of them before opening a PR.

### Unit tests

```bash
make test
```

Every `internal/*` package has its own `_test.go` files. Several packages
carry **regression fixtures captured from a real `hf_xet` client session**
(`internal/casserver/testdata/`, `internal/lz4/testdata/`,
`internal/shardformat/testdata/`) - these exist because the real client's
wire format differs from the documented spec in a few places (see
[docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md)), and replaying the exact bytes that
once broke this server is the strongest regression guard against
re-introducing those bugs. Don't delete or "clean up" these fixtures.

To run a single package's tests:

```bash
go test -v ./internal/merklehash/...
```

### Integration tests (bash, against a live server)

```bash
make integration-test
# or a single script:
make integration-test TEST=integration-tests/push_pull_roundtrip.sh
```

`integrationTests.sh` starts one `xetd` instance (both the CAS server and
the Hub API shim) and runs every `integration-tests/*.sh` script against
it, with a per-test timeout (`XET_IT_TEST_TIMEOUT`, default 10s; a script
that needs longer declares `# XET_IT_TEST_TIMEOUT: N` in its header) so a
single hanging test doesn't block the whole suite. Scripts receive `$XET`,
`$XETD`, `$XET_PROXYD` (the built `xet-proxyd` binary, for tests that
start their own proxy instance rather than using the shared `xetd`),
`$XETD_URL`, `$HUB_URL`, `$WORKDIR`, and `$PYTHON_VERSION` - see the
header comment in `integrationTests.sh` for the full contract.

A test script can `exit 77` to **SKIP** instead of fail, for cases that
depend on an optional external dependency not being present (see
`integration-tests/hf_cli_roundtrip.sh` for the pattern).

### Real `hf` CLI round-trip

`integration-tests/hf_cli_roundtrip.sh` drives the actual `hf upload`/
`hf download` shell commands (via `huggingface_hub` + `hf_xet`, installed
through `pipenv` - not this project's own client) against the shared test
server. This is the strongest possible compatibility check, since it never
touches this repo's own code on the client side. It's optional and skips
cleanly if `pipenv`/its environment aren't set up:

```bash
make install             # pipenv --python 3.14 && pipenv install
make integration-test    # will now include and run hf_cli_roundtrip.sh
```

If it hangs or times out in a sandboxed/proxied network environment, that's
a known environment limitation (`hf_xet`'s Rust HTTP client doesn't always
honor `NO_PROXY` for localhost), not a protocol bug - see the script's
header comment and [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) for details.

### Several machines against one server

`integration-tests/multi_client_*.sh` (sharing
`integration-tests/lib/multi_client.bash`) run the real `hf` CLI as named
clients, each with its own `HF_HOME`, `HF_XET_CACHE` and token, against a
private `xetd` started with `DEBUG=1`. The point: a xet client dedups a
new upload against its own shard cache before asking the server, so with
one cache the server's answer to `GET /v1/chunks/{prefix}/{hash}` is
never parsed by anyone. Two bugs in that answer (the prefix real clients
send was rejected; the bytes returned had no footer and could not be
loaded) passed every single-client test and surfaced only when git-xet
pushed from a second machine. Each of these tests asserts the cross-client
path it names from the server's request log and the client's hf_xet log
(`$HF_XET_CACHE/logs/`), not just from the bytes coming back, so it cannot
pass vacuously. When adding a case where a second person uploads or
downloads, give them a fresh client name; sharing a cache tests the
cache, not the server.

`integration-tests/xet_proxyd_offline_handoff.sh` uses the same real `hf`
CLI to prove `xet-proxyd`'s whole reason to exist: upload+download through
a running proxy (relaying to a second, local `xetd` standing in for the
real Hub, so this needs no network access), shut the proxy down, tear
down its upstream entirely, start a fresh plain `xetd` pointed at the
proxy's own `-data` directory, and download the same file again with
nothing else running. This is what caught two real bugs during
development - a missing `shouldIgnore` field silently dropped on relay
(crashed the real `hf` CLI with a `KeyError`) and a snapshot-filename
mismatch between the two binaries that would have made the whole handoff
silently load nothing - both fixed and now pinned by this test and unit
regression tests alongside it.

`integration-tests/xet_proxyd_write_relay.sh` covers the proxy's write
path **without** needing `pipenv`/`hf`: it starts its own upstream `xetd`
(the stand-in "real Hub") and its own `xet-proxyd` in front of it, then
drives create-repo, a preupload body carrying the `sample` field, and an
ndjson commit through the proxy with plain `curl`, asserting the upstream's
responses are relayed back 200. This pins the fixes that make real `hf
upload` work through the proxy against the live Hub (raw write-body
relay - see [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) #12).

### Fuzz tests

Every binary/wire-format parser that touches attacker-controlled bytes has
a native Go fuzz test (`go test -fuzz`, no external fuzzing framework)
in a `fuzz_test.go` alongside its package: `internal/merklehash`,
`internal/lz4`, `internal/bg4`, `internal/xorbformat`,
`internal/shardformat`, `internal/casserver` (just `parseByteRange`).
These found a real, confirmed allocation-size DoS during this project's
first fuzzing pass - see [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md)'s #7 for the
full story and the general rule it generalizes to. `internal/reconwire`
(the reconstruction-response clipping/grouping logic, extracted out of
`casserver` so `proxycas` can safely feed it untrusted upstream data via
`casserver.Server.IngestFileRecon`) has its own fuzz target,
`FuzzBuildV1_NeverPanics`, verifying arbitrary out-of-range chunk indices
return an error instead of panicking - the exact bug class this
extraction was designed to make independently testable.

**Textual input counts too.** A URL path off the request line is exactly
as attacker-controlled as a xorb body, and hand-slicing one around a
separator is precisely the code that breaks on an input nobody thought to
try. `internal/hubserver`'s `fuzz_test.go` covers the resolve-path and
LFS-batch path parsers; `lfsbatch_fuzz_test.go` drives arbitrary bodies
through the batch endpoint over a real `httptest` server; and
`internal/casserver`'s `snapshot_fuzz_test.go` fuzzes the v2 snapshot
round-trip. These found two real bugs on their first run:

- `//resolve//0` was **accepted**, yielding a repo ID of `/` with an empty
  namespace *and* name - an identity no real request can address, which
  would then be created as live server state.
- `{"operAtion":"upload"}00` was **accepted**: `json.Decoder.Decode` reads
  the first JSON value and silently ignores trailing bytes (and matches
  field names case-insensitively). Lenient trailing-data handling is how
  two intermediaries end up disagreeing about what a request said.

Both now reject, and both failing inputs are committed under
`testdata/fuzz/` as permanent regression cases.

```bash
make test-fuzz                  # every target, 30s each (override FUZZTIME=5m)
make fuzz-seeds                 # replay committed corpora only - fast, deterministic
make test-race                  # unit tests under the race detector

# or one target directly:
go test ./internal/shardformat/... -run '^$' -fuzz '^FuzzReadShard$' -fuzztime 60s
```

`make test-fuzz` depends on `fuzz-seeds`, so the committed corpora (every
previously-found crash) replay before any time is spent hunting for new
inputs - if an old bug is back, you find out immediately rather than after
`FUZZTIME` per target. CI runs the corpus replay under `-race` on every
push plus a short 20s-per-target hunt; the soak case is
`make test-fuzz FUZZTIME=5m` locally.

Note that `-race` and `-fuzz` are deliberately separate targets: the race
detector slows execution by roughly an order of magnitude, so combining
them within a fixed time budget explores far fewer inputs. Also, the race
detector requires a 64-bit toolchain - on a 32-bit Go/MinGW setup
`go test -race` fails at startup with `exit status 0xc0000139`
(`STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND`), which is a toolchain limitation, not a
test failure. CI runs it on 64-bit Linux.

`-run '^$'` skips running the package's regular tests first (fuzzing
implicitly runs the seed corpus as regular test cases anyway); drop it if
you want both. If a fuzzer finds a crash, it writes the failing input to
`testdata/fuzz/<FuzzName>/<hash>` in that package - commit that file as a
permanent regression seed once you've fixed the bug it found, the same
way `internal/casserver/testdata/`'s real-capture fixtures are committed.

If you're on a machine where the default Go build cache directory isn't
writable (e.g. a locked-down sandbox), set `GOCACHE` to somewhere it is:
`GOCACHE=$(mktemp -d) go test ... -fuzz ...`.

### Adversarial and chaos tests

`*/adversarial_test.go` (in `internal/casserver`, `internal/hubserver`)
post deliberately malformed/hostile payloads at the real HTTP handlers -
truncated bodies, hostile path segments, malformed `Range` headers,
`Content-Length` lies - and assert both a clean error response *and* that
the server keeps working correctly afterward. `internal/casserver/chaos_test.go`
goes further: sustained concurrent mixed valid/invalid traffic, an
upload interrupted mid-body followed by a clean retry, and
upload/fetch/eviction-sweep interleaving under a tight storage budget -
each checked against actual data integrity (byte-identical round-trips),
not just "didn't crash." `internal/proxycas/chaos_test.go` and
`internal/proxyhub/chaos_test.go` cover the same class of scenario for
`xet-proxyd` specifically - a fully-hung-before-headers upstream, a
connected-but-frozen mid-body response, a connection reset mid-transfer,
and thundering-herd concurrent requests on a cold cache key - each
asserting the proxy's fallback-to-cache rule still holds and that a
truncated/reset upstream response is never cached as if it were complete
(`casserver.IngestXorb`'s independent hash re-derivation is what actually
guarantees this; the chaos tests confirm it empirically rather than
assuming it). Run these as part of `make test` like any other Go test;
they're intentionally fast enough not to need a separate target.

### Benchmarks

`*/benchmark_test.go` covers chunking (`internal/chunk`), hashing
(`internal/merklehash`), LZ4/ByteGrouping4 decompression (`internal/lz4`,
`internal/bg4`), and dedup speed (`internal/api` - fully-duplicate vs.
always-unique upload throughput at the same size, quantifying what dedup
actually buys in wall-clock terms):

```bash
go test ./internal/merklehash/... -bench . -benchtime 1s -benchmem -run '^$'
```

## 3. Working with Documentation

This project uses **godoc comments as the source of truth** for
implementation details, with a small Go program
(`scripts/build_docs.go`, its own module so the main `xet-server` module
keeps zero external dependencies) to make them - and every other
Markdown doc in this repo - browsable:

1. **Every package has a `// Package foo ...` comment** directly above its
   `package foo` declaration, on exactly one file in that package (Go
   convention - don't duplicate it across files). These comments are
   substantial: they explain *why* the package exists and what real-world
   spec/source it's porting or implementing, not just what the code does
   mechanically. Read a few in `internal/merklehash/datahash.go` or
   `internal/casserver/casserver.go` for the expected depth.
2. **Exported types and functions get a doc comment** starting with the
   identifier's name (`// XorbHash computes ...`), per standard Go
   convention, so `go doc` and godoc.org-style tooling render correctly.
3. **Non-obvious "why" comments belong inline**, not in a separate design
   doc - e.g. a citation to the exact xet-core source file/behavior a piece
   of code mirrors, or the reason a workaround exists. See
   [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) for the cases substantial enough to
   warrant a standalone writeup instead.

View a package's rendered docs locally:

```bash
go doc ./internal/merklehash
go doc ./internal/merklehash Hash.Hex
```

Or regenerate the committed `docs/godoc/*.md` package reference and render
every doc (README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, `docs/*.md`, `docs/godoc/*.md`)
to browsable HTML:

```bash
make docs          # -> docs/godoc/*.md (commit these) + docs/build/*.html
make docs-serve    # same, then serves docs/build/ locally
```

`docs/godoc/*.md` is committed source - it's plain Markdown, so it renders
natively on GitHub with no build step. `docs/build/` is a disposable,
gitignored build artifact; never commit it.

If you add a new package, give it a `// Package foo ...` comment before
opening a PR - `go vet` won't catch a missing one, but reviewers will.

## 4. Branching and Pull Requests

- **`main`** contains the latest stable code; branch from it.
- **Feature branches**: `feature/short-description`. **Fixes**:
  `fix/short-description`.
- **PR titles** should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  (`feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`) so the history stays scannable.
- Run `make all` before opening a PR (format, vet, build, unit tests,
  integration tests). Fill out the PR template checklist.

## 6. Where to Look for Protocol Details

If you're changing anything in `casserver`, `hubserver`, `xorbformat`,
`shardformat`, `merklehash`, `lz4`, or `bg4`, read
[docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) first - it documents several places
where the real `hf_xet`/xet-core wire format differs from what the public
OpenAPI spec or source comments imply, discovered only by capturing and
replaying real client traffic. Silently "fixing" one of these to match the
spec instead of the real client will break compatibility again.
