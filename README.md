# Xet Server

A Go server that is **wire-compatible** with Hugging Face's real [Xet
storage protocol](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/xet/index) — the
content-defined-chunking, dedup-first storage layer that replaces Git LFS
for large model files on the Hub. Point the real `hf` CLI
(`huggingface_hub` + `hf_xet`) at this server and it works: `hf upload`,
`hf download`, byte-identical round-trips, real BLAKE3 hashing, real
xorb/shard binary formats, real LZ4/byte-grouping compression.

This started as a simplified, non-wire-compatible chunking/dedup demo
(kept in `internal/chunk`, `internal/manifest`, `internal/api`, `cmd/xet`
for quick manual testing) and grew into a from-scratch, spec-driven
reimplementation of the actual protocol — verified end-to-end against a
live `hf_xet` client, with several real wire-format quirks discovered only
by capturing and replaying genuine client traffic. See
[docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) for that story.

Also included: **`xet-proxyd`**, a caching pull-through proxy for the real
huggingface.co — not just a performance cache, but an offline-resilience
layer. Point it at the real Hub, use it like a normal `HF_ENDPOINT`, and
every repo/file it has successfully served once stays servable via `hf
download`/`hf upload` even after huggingface.co becomes unreachable —
including handing its cache directory to a plain `xetd` as a permanent,
disconnected replacement. See [Caching pull-through proxy](#caching-pull-through-proxy-xet-proxyd)
below.

# Features

- **Wire-compatible CAS HTTP API** (`internal/casserver`): xorb
  upload/fetch, shard upload, file reconstruction with Range-based paging,
  matching xet-core's own `openapi/cas.openapi.yaml` — verified
  byte-identical against a real `hf_xet` client, for both compressible and
  incompressible content.
- **Hub API shim** (`internal/hubserver`): enough of huggingface.co's Hub
  REST API (repo create, preupload, `xet-{read,write}-token`, commit,
  resolve/HEAD) that the real `hf upload`/`hf download` shell commands work
  against this server via `HF_ENDPOINT` — including real, independent
  revisions/branches per repo, not just an implicit `main`.
- **`xet-proxyd`: a caching pull-through proxy for the real huggingface.co**
  (`cmd/xet-proxyd`, `internal/proxycas`, `internal/proxyhub`,
  `internal/hfclient`) — an offline-resilience layer, not just a
  performance cache: any repo metadata or xorb bytes it has successfully
  relayed once stay servable even after the real huggingface.co becomes
  unreachable, and its cache directory is a real `xetd` data directory a
  plain `xetd` can take over directly, no proxy process required. See
  [Caching pull-through proxy](#caching-pull-through-proxy-xet-proxyd).
- **Real BLAKE3-keyed Merkle hashing** (`internal/merklehash`): a
  byte-for-byte port of xet-core's `DataHash`, verified against xet-core's
  own published reference vectors — not an approximation.
- **Real xorb and shard binary formats** (`internal/xorbformat`,
  `internal/shardformat`), each verified against real bytes captured from
  a live `hf_xet` upload, including the footer-less upload behavior real
  clients actually use (see [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md)).
- **From-scratch LZ4 decoder and ByteGrouping4 codec** (`internal/lz4`,
  `internal/bg4`): written directly from the public LZ4 spec / verified
  against a third-party reference implementation, so chunk hashes can be
  independently re-verified regardless of compression scheme.
- **Pluggable, streaming storage** (`internal/storage`): a `Store`
  interface with filesystem (`fsstore`) and S3-compatible (`s3store`)
  backends, built on `io.Reader`/`io.ReadCloser` rather than `[]byte` —
  neither backend ever buffers a full object in memory, so a multi-GB
  upload/download costs a fixed amount of memory. The S3 backend uses a
  from-scratch AWS SigV4 signer (`internal/sigv4`), no AWS SDK dependency.
  Verified end-to-end with real GGUF model files up to 27.6 GB.
- **Zero required external dependencies to build the demo path**; the
  protocol path adds exactly one pure-Go module
  (`github.com/zeebo/blake3`), pinned in `go.sum`.
- **Optional storage auto-pruning and request rate limiting**
  (`internal/eviction`, `internal/ratelimit`): bounded, observable
  defense-in-depth for a server left running against untrusted traffic —
  neither adds a dependency, and both are off unless explicitly enabled.
  `xetd` rate-limits uploads only (the expensive local operation there);
  `xet-proxyd` rate-limits every route on both ports, since even a read
  can trigger a real outbound call to the real huggingface.co.
- **Optional dedup-hit content verification** (`internal/storage`'s
  `VerifyingStore`): byte-compares an incoming upload against the stored
  blob on a dedup hit instead of trusting the content hash alone,
  bailing at the first mismatch — a hash-collision/corruption safety net,
  off by default since it roughly doubles I/O on a dedup hit.
- **A real global chunk-dedup index and V2 (multi-range) reconstruction**
  (`internal/casserver`): `GET /v1/chunks/{prefix}/{hash}` returns the
  actual shard bytes referencing a queried chunk (the real wire contract,
  confirmed against xet-core's own client source), and
  `GET /v2/reconstructions/{file_id}` returns the multi-range-optimized
  response shape instead of always falling back to V1.
- **Restart-surviving metadata persistence**: `casserver`/`hubserver`
  (and, identically, `xet-proxyd`'s embedded copies of each) periodically
  (and on graceful shutdown) checkpoint their in-memory
  reconstruction/repo indices to disk as an atomic JSON snapshot — see
  `-snapshot-interval` below.
- **Real-client regression fixtures**: several packages carry
  `testdata/` captured directly from a live `hf_xet` session, replayed in
  unit tests — the strongest guard against silently regressing wire
  compatibility.

# Architecture

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full system
diagram (upload/download sequence diagrams, package responsibility table,
and the key design decisions). Short version:

- `cmd/xetd` runs the CAS server, and — with `-hub-addr` — the Hub API shim
  as a second HTTP listener, matching how huggingface.co's real Hub and
  CAS are actually separate services.
- `cmd/xet-proxyd` runs a caching pull-through proxy in front of the real
  huggingface.co, on the same two-port shape as `xetd` — a drop-in
  alternative for the same ports, backed by the real Hub instead of being
  the only copy of the data. See
  [Caching pull-through proxy](#caching-pull-through-proxy-xet-proxyd).
- `cmd/xet` is a small CLI for the Xet Data API only (not the
  wire-compatible protocol — use the real `hf` CLI for that).

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.27 or later
- GNU Make
- Bash (for integration tests)
- (Optional, for the real `hf` CLI round-trip test) `pipenv`, to install
  `huggingface_hub` + `hf_xet`
- (Optional) `merman-cli` or `mmdc` (mermaid-cli), to render Mermaid
  diagrams as SVG in `make docs`/`make docs-serve` — falls back to a
  source + mermaid.live link if neither is available

If `pipenv` can't reach `pypi.org` directly (a corporate proxy, an
air-gapped environment), copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set
`PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR` to a reachable index mirror; `.env` is read by
`make install` and is gitignored.

## Build

```bash
make pre-check   # verify Go/bash are present
make build       # -> bin/xetd, bin/xet-proxyd, bin/xet
```

# Usage

## Run the wire-compatible server

```bash
# CAS server only, on :8420
./bin/xetd -addr :8420 -data ./xet-data

# CAS server + Hub API shim (needed for the real hf CLI), on :8420 / :8421
./bin/xetd -addr :8420 -hub-addr :8421 -data ./xet-data

# With storage auto-pruning (evict least-recently-used xorbs over 10GB,
# checked every 5 minutes) and per-source-IP upload rate limiting (5
# requests/sec sustained, burst of 20) — both optional, both off by default:
./bin/xetd -addr :8420 -data ./xet-data \
  -max-storage-bytes 10737418240 -eviction-interval 5m \
  -rate-limit-rps 5 -rate-limit-burst 20

# With dedup-hit content verification (see "Storage backends" below) and
# a faster persistence checkpoint interval than the 1-minute default:
./bin/xetd -addr :8420 -data ./xet-data -verify-dedup -snapshot-interval 15s
```

Opening either port's root path (`http://localhost:8420/` or, if
`-hub-addr` is set, `http://localhost:8421/`) in a browser shows a landing
page listing every endpoint that port serves — useful for orienting
yourself without needing to read this README first.

## Authentication

By default `xetd` enforces no authentication at all — any client can read
and write, matching this project's behavior prior to v0.8.0. Passing
`-auth-token <secret>` (or, preferably, setting `$XETD_AUTH_TOKEN`) requires
every request to carry `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`, split into
read/write scope per endpoint (uploads/commits need write; downloads/
reconstructions/resolve need read) the same way real Xet/HF Hub tokens
work. `-auth-token None` (the default) or leaving it unset disables
enforcement entirely.

```bash
export XETD_AUTH_TOKEN="a-long-random-secret"
./bin/xetd -addr :8420 -hub-addr :8421 -data ./xet-data

./bin/xet push -server http://localhost:8420 -auth-token "a-long-random-secret" ./model.safetensors
# or, equivalently, export XET_AUTH_TOKEN (or HF_TOKEN, the same variable
# the real `hf` CLI reads) instead of passing -auth-token:
export XET_AUTH_TOKEN="a-long-random-secret"
./bin/xet push -server http://localhost:8420 ./model.safetensors
```

**Prefer the environment variable over the flag** ($XETD_AUTH_TOKEN /
$XET_AUTH_TOKEN) whenever the machine is shared or the command runs where
its argument list might be logged: a `-auth-token` flag value is visible to
any other local user via `ps -ef` / `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` and gets written
to shell history, while an environment variable set through a secrets
manager, a `.env` file kept out of history, or `read -s` is not. An
explicit `-auth-token` flag always takes precedence over the environment
variable if both are set, so scripts that need to override a
machine-wide/session-wide token can still do so per invocation.

`-auth-token`/the env vars above configure this project's built-in
`auth.StaticTokenAuth` (server) and `auth.BearerCredentialHelper` (client)
— a single shared secret. Both sides are defined as small interfaces
(`auth.Authenticator`/`auth.Principal` server-side,
`auth.CredentialHelper` client-side) in `internal/auth`, so implementing
your own (e.g. per-user tokens, JWT validation, mTLS) is a matter of
satisfying those interfaces and calling `SetAuthenticator`/setting
`client.Client.Cred` — no changes to `casserver`, `hubserver`, or
`internal/api` required.

## Point the real `hf` CLI at it

```bash
export HF_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8421"   # the Hub shim's address
export HF_TOKEN="anything"                    # ignored unless xetd was started with -auth-token/$XETD_AUTH_TOKEN — see Authentication above

hf upload myuser/my-model ./model.safetensors model.safetensors
hf download myuser/my-model model.safetensors --local-dir ./downloaded
cmp ./model.safetensors ./downloaded/model.safetensors   # byte-identical
```

You can also drive `hf_xet`'s low-level `XetSession` Python API directly
against the CAS server's own address (`:8420` above) with no Hub API
involved at all — useful for isolating whether an issue is in the CAS
protocol or the Hub shim.

Want to run this as a real, standing mirror rather than a one-off local
test? See **[docs/MIRRORING.md](docs/MIRRORING.md)** for a full
step-by-step guide (securing it, pointing multiple machines at it,
troubleshooting).

## Xet Data API + CLI

A simple, non-wire-compatible gear-hash-CDC + JSON-manifest API is also
available for quick manual testing, mounted on the same `xetd` process at
`/v1/upload`, `/v1/files`, `/v1/stats` — sharing the `/v1` namespace with
the CAS protocol on a disjoint set of literal paths (`internal/api`'s
exported `UploadPath`/`FilesPrefix`/`StatsPath` constants are the single
source of truth for these, referenced by both `cmd/xetd`'s route table
and `internal/client`, so the path never drifts between server and
client). `-server` (both flags below are optional) falls back to
`$XET_SERVER`, then `http://localhost:8420`:

```bash
export XET_SERVER="http://localhost:8420"   # optional; -server overrides it per-invocation
./bin/xet push /path/to/model.safetensors
# -> file_id:  2d53223aa33715f0eff757537ed9cf8f
#    chunks:   28 total, 28 new
#    stored:   2000000 bytes (0.0% deduplicated)

./bin/xet push /path/to/model-v2.safetensors   # a near-duplicate checkpoint
# -> chunks:   30 total, 4 new
#    stored:   436017 bytes (81.0% deduplicated)

./bin/xet pull -out ./restored.safetensors 2d53223aa33715f0eff757537ed9cf8f
./bin/xet stats
```

**No per-file ownership/isolation.** `file_id` is the SHA-256 of the
uploaded content — this API has no repo or user concept at all, so `-auth-token`
here (if enabled) only gates read/write access to the API as a whole, not
per-file: any caller with a valid read-scoped token (or none, if auth is
disabled) can fetch any `file_id` it knows, the same trust model as CAS's
own `/v1/xorbs/{hash}`. File IDs are not secrets and this store is not
multi-tenant — don't run it multi-tenant without adding that isolation
yourself first.

# Caching pull-through proxy (`xet-proxyd`)

`xet-proxyd` sits in front of the **real** huggingface.co and transparently
caches everything it relays — not primarily for speed, but for
**offline resilience**: once it has successfully served a repo's metadata
or a file's xorb bytes, that data keeps being servable via `hf download`/
`hf upload` even if huggingface.co goes down, gets rate-limited, or
disappears entirely. It's built by embedding the exact same
`internal/casserver.Server`/`internal/hubserver.Server` engines `xetd`
uses, rather than reimplementing caching logic separately — so its cache
directory is a real `xetd` data directory a plain `xetd` can take over
directly, with no proxy process running at all (see
[Offline handoff](#offline-handoff-proving-the-point) below).

```bash
# Two ports, same shape as xetd: -addr (CAS-facing), -hub-addr (Hub-facing).
# Point HF_ENDPOINT at -hub-addr and the real hf CLI works through it
# end-to-end, same as pointing it at a local xetd.
./bin/xet-proxyd -addr :8420 -hub-addr :8421 -data ./xet-proxy-data

export HF_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8421"
export HF_TOKEN="anything"   # forwarded upstream unchanged — see below
hf download someuser/some-model --local-dir ./downloaded
```

Or via `make run-proxy` (same as above, with `./xet-proxy-data`).

Same as `xetd`, opening either port's root path in a browser shows a
landing page ("Xet Proxy Server" / "Xet Proxy Server — Hub API shim")
listing that port's endpoints; the CAS-facing port also serves the same
offline Swagger UI at `/api-docs/` (identical spec — the wire protocol is
the same one `xetd` implements). Note the CAS-facing port can't answer
anything about a repo it hasn't seen yet until the Hub-facing port relays
at least one real Hub call — see the "bootstrap" note below.

**Every request that can't be served from cache is relayed live to the
real huggingface.co** (`-upstream-hub-url`, defaulting to
`https://huggingface.co`, falling back to `$HF_URL`) — the caller's own
`Authorization` header is forwarded upstream completely unchanged
(`internal/hfclient`'s pure-passthrough design: this proxy never holds or
uses a credential of its own). `-auth-token`/`$XET_PROXYD_AUTH_TOKEN`
gates access to **this proxy itself** — a separate concern from the
upstream credential entirely.

**Any upstream failure — network error, timeout, 5xx — falls back to
whatever is already cached, no matter how old**, rather than erroring;
this fallback is the whole reason the proxy exists. `-cache-ttl` (default
`-1`, meaning "always try upstream first") controls how long cached Hub
metadata (repo-info, tree, xet-token, resolve) is served without even
attempting a live refresh; it never affects the CAS byte cache, which is
content-addressed and can't go stale by definition. `-metadata-call-timeout`
(default `30s`) bounds each individual metadata call so a slow-but-not-dead
upstream doesn't hold up the fallback path longer than necessary — it
never applies to tree listing, which pages internally within one call and
can legitimately take longer for a very large repo.

`-no-cache` disables all of this — a pure-relay escape hatch (every
request goes straight to upstream, nothing is read or written locally)
for when you specifically want a stateless relay rather than the default
offline-resilient caching mode.

**Bootstrap note: the CAS-facing port needs the Hub-facing port to have
relayed at least one real request first.** Real Xet CAS has no single
well-known base URL — each repo's Hub `xet-{read,write}-token` response
hands back a *per-repo* CAS URL, and the CAS-facing proxy only learns it
as a side effect of the Hub-facing proxy relaying one of those calls. A
request straight to `-addr` (a raw `curl`, or `hf_xet`'s low-level API
pointed directly at the CAS port) before ANY traffic has gone through
`-hub-addr` gets `503 upstream CAS URL not yet known`. Always drive
traffic through `HF_ENDPOINT` pointed at `-hub-addr` first — a real `hf
download`/`hf upload` (or even just one xet-token round-trip) — and the
CAS port works for the rest of that process's life, including everything
already cached from a previous run.

Rate limiting (`-rate-limit-rps`/`-rate-limit-burst`, off by default)
gates **every route on both ports**, not just uploads like `xetd`'s own
`-rate-limit-rps` — a cache-missing read costs a real outbound call to
huggingface.co just as much as a write does, so both need the same
protection. One shared limiter covers both ports, so a client can't double
its effective budget by splitting requests across them.

`-snapshot-interval` (default `1m`) persists both the CAS-facing and
Hub-facing caches to `-data` — using the **exact same filenames** `xetd`
itself reads and writes (`casserver-snapshot.json`/
`hubserver-snapshot.json`), which is what makes the handoff below work at
all.

## Offline handoff, proving the point

```bash
# 1. Cache something while online:
./bin/xet-proxyd -addr :8420 -hub-addr :8421 -data ./xet-proxy-data &
HF_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8421 hf download someuser/some-model --local-dir ./downloaded

# 2. Stop the proxy (a final snapshot is taken automatically):
kill %1

# 3. huggingface.co is gone / unreachable / you're fully offline now.
#    Point a PLAIN xetd at the SAME data directory — no -upstream-hub-url,
#    no network, nothing but what step 1 already cached:
./bin/xetd -addr :8420 -hub-addr :8421 -data ./xet-proxy-data

# 4. The exact same download still works, byte-identical, forever:
HF_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8421 hf download someuser/some-model --local-dir ./downloaded-again
cmp -r ./downloaded ./downloaded-again
```

This isn't a hypothetical — `integration-tests/xet_proxyd_offline_handoff.sh`
runs exactly this sequence (against a local stand-in Hub, so it needs no
network access) as part of `make integration-test`: upload+download
through the proxy via the real `hf` CLI, shut the proxy down, tear down
its upstream entirely, start a fresh plain `xetd` on the handed-off data
directory, and download again with nothing else running. This is `xet-proxyd`'s
whole reason to exist: a practical path off huggingface.co, not just a
faster mirror of it.

# HTTP API

## Interactive API docs (Swagger UI)

Every endpoint below is also documented as an OpenAPI 3.0 spec
(`docs/openapi.yaml` — hand-authored and verified against the actual
handler source, not generated) and served through a fully offline Swagger
UI at `/api-docs/` on the CAS server's address:

```bash
./bin/xetd -addr :8420 -data ./xet-data
open http://localhost:8420/api-docs/   # or just visit it in a browser
```

"Fully offline" means exactly that: the Swagger UI static assets
(`third_party/swagger-ui-dist`, vendored from the
[swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) project) and the
spec itself are both compiled directly into the `xetd` binary via Go's
`embed` package (see `internal/apidocs`) — no CDN dependency, and it works
identically on an air-gapped machine.

## CAS protocol (wire-compatible, mounted at `/v1`, `/v2`)

- `POST /v1/xorbs/{prefix}/{hash}` — upload a serialized xorb (chunk
  headers + payloads, no footer — see PROTOCOL.md)
- `GET /v1/xorbs/{prefix}/{hash}` — fetch raw (possibly compressed) xorb
  bytes, honors `Range`
- `POST /v1/shards` — upload a serialized shard (file/xorb info sections,
  no footer)
- `GET /v1/reconstructions/{file_id}` — file → xorb/chunk-range map,
  honors `Range`, returns `416` at EOF
- `GET /v1/chunks/{prefix}/{hash}` — global chunk-dedup lookup: returns
  the raw bytes of whichever uploaded shard referenced this chunk hash
  (the real wire contract — a client parses the shard itself), `404` if
  no uploaded shard has ever referenced it
- `GET /v2/reconstructions/{file_id}` — multi-range-optimized
  reconstruction: same underlying terms/byte-ranges as V1, grouped by
  xorb (one signed URL covering multiple ranges) instead of one entry per
  term
- `POST /v1/telemetry` — no-op ack
- `GET /v1/storage-stats` — eviction policy stats (operator-facing; not
  part of the real Xet CAS API — see [Storage backends](#storage-backends))

## Hub API shim (mounted on a separate port via `-hub-addr`)

- `POST /api/repos/create`
- `GET /api/{repo_type}s/{repo_id}/revision/{revision}` — repo info at a
  revision (huggingface_hub's `snapshot_download` resolves this before a
  whole-repo `hf download`)
- `GET /api/{repo_type}s/{repo_id}/tree/{revision}` — list every file
  committed to a revision
- `POST /api/{repo_type}s/{repo_id}/branch/{branch}` — create a branch
- `POST /api/{repo_type}s/{repo_id}/preupload/{revision}`
- `GET /api/{repo_type}s/{repo_id}/xet-{read,write}-token/{revision}`
- `POST /api/{repo_type}s/{repo_id}/commit/{revision}`
- `HEAD`/`GET /{repo_id}/resolve/{revision}/{filename}`

## Xet Data API (mounted at `/v1`, alongside the CAS protocol)

- `POST /v1/upload?name=<optional>` — chunks + dedups the uploaded file
- `GET /v1/files/{id}` / `GET /v1/files/{id}/manifest` / `GET /v1/stats`

# Storage backends

`internal/storage.Store` is the abstraction both `casserver` and the Xet
Data API store chunk/xorb bytes through:

- **`fsstore`** — content-addressed filesystem directory (the default)
- **`s3store`** — any S3-compatible endpoint (AWS S3, MinIO), signed with
  the from-scratch `internal/sigv4` signer. Set `XET_S3STORE_LIVE_TEST=1`
  plus `XET_TEST_S3_*` env vars to run its tests against a real MinIO
  instance.

## Storage auto-pruning, upload rate limiting, dedup verification, and persistence

All off/on-defaults below; opt in or tune via `xetd` flags:

- `-max-storage-bytes N -eviction-interval 5m` — once total xorb storage
  exceeds `N` bytes, a background sweep (`internal/eviction`) deletes
  least-recently-accessed xorbs (upload or fetch both count as access)
  until back under budget, skipping any xorb with a fetch currently in
  progress. `GET /v1/storage-stats` reports the configured budget and
  cumulative evictions/bytes freed. A client that later needs an evicted
  xorb must re-upload it — real Xet clients already treat CAS storage as
  non-permanent and handle this by re-deriving from the source file. Off
  by default.
- `-rate-limit-rps N -rate-limit-burst N` — caps xorb/shard uploads per
  source IP via a hand-rolled token bucket (`internal/ratelimit`, no new
  dependency). Exceeding the limit returns `429` with `Retry-After`.
  Fetch/reconstruction/HEAD traffic is never rate-limited. Off by default.
- `-verify-dedup` — on every dedup hit (a `Put` for a content hash that
  already exists), byte-compare the incoming upload against the stored
  blob instead of trusting the content hash alone, bailing at the first
  mismatched byte rather than reading either side in full
  (`internal/storage.VerifyingStore`). A mismatch (a hash collision or
  undetected storage corruption) refuses the write — the original stored
  blob is never overwritten — and logs at `Error`, distinct from routine
  request-failure logging. Roughly 10x slower than the default trust-the-hash
  path on a dedup hit (a full extra read), which is why it's opt-in, not
  the default. Off by default.
- `-snapshot-interval 1m` — how often `casserver`/`hubserver`'s in-memory
  reconstruction/repo indices are checkpointed to `-data` as JSON (an
  atomic stage-then-rename write, the same pattern the storage backends
  use), so they survive a restart. A graceful shutdown (`Ctrl-C`/`SIGTERM`)
  always takes one final snapshot first. This is a periodic checkpoint,
  not a write-ahead log — anything written between two checkpoints is
  lost on an *un*graceful termination (a crash, `kill -9`, power loss);
  see [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md)'s persistence section for the
  full tradeoff writeup. Set to `0` to disable periodic snapshotting
  (a final snapshot is still taken on graceful shutdown). Defaults to 1
  minute.

# Testing

```bash
make test               # unit tests, all packages
make integration-test   # bash integration suite against a live server
```

`integrationTests.sh` starts one `xetd` instance (CAS + Hub shim) and runs
every script in `integration-tests/`, with a per-test timeout so a hang
doesn't block the suite. `integration-tests/hf_cli_roundtrip.sh` drives the
**real, unmodified `hf` CLI** through a full upload+download round-trip —
the strongest compatibility check available — and skips cleanly (not a
failure) if `pipenv`/its environment aren't set up. `integration-tests/xet_proxyd_offline_handoff.sh`
proves `xet-proxyd`'s whole reason to exist the same way: real `hf`
upload+download through a running proxy, then the proxy AND its upstream
are both torn down entirely and a plain `xetd` takes over the proxy's data
directory directly — the same download must still succeed, byte-identical,
with nothing but that directory:

```bash
make install             # pipenv --python 3.14 && pipenv install
make integration-test    # now includes hf_cli_roundtrip.sh and xet_proxyd_offline_handoff.sh
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#2-running-tests) for the full test
layer breakdown, including why several packages carry real-client
`testdata/` fixtures, native Go fuzz tests for every wire-format parser,
adversarial/chaos tests against a live server, and dedup/hashing/
compression benchmarks.

Package-level godoc comments are the source of truth for implementation
details not covered above:

```bash
go doc ./internal/merklehash
go doc ./internal/casserver
```

`make docs` regenerates the committed `docs/godoc/*.md` package reference
(via `go doc -all`) and renders every Markdown doc in this repo to
browsable HTML in `docs/build/`; `make docs-serve` does the same and then
serves it locally. Both are implemented by `scripts/build_docs.go` (its
own Go module, so the main `xet-server` module keeps zero external
dependencies).

# Where this diverges from real Xet

Every divergence tracked in prior versions of this doc has been closed:
real revisions/branches, V2 reconstruction, a global chunk-dedup index,
restart-surviving persistence (all as of v0.7.0), and pluggable
authentication/authorization (as of v0.8.0 — see
[Authentication](#authentication)).

`xet-proxyd` (new in v0.9.0) has one known, deliberate gap: on a cold
start with `-hub-addr` disabled (or before the Hub-facing port has relayed
any traffic), the CAS-facing port has no way to learn the real upstream
CAS base URL and returns `503` for anything it doesn't already have
cached — see the bootstrap note in
[Caching pull-through proxy](#caching-pull-through-proxy-xet-proxyd).
This is inherent to how real Xet CAS's base URL is discovered (per-repo,
via the Hub's own token response, not a fixed well-known address), not a
gap this project could close without deviating from the real protocol.

# Troubleshooting

### Debugging `xetd` itself
Run `xetd` with `DEBUG=1` to log every HTTP request it receives (method,
path, status, duration) plus commit/shard/resolve lookup details at debug
level via the standard library's `log/slog`:

```bash
DEBUG=1 ./bin/xetd -addr :8420 -hub-addr :8421 -data ./xet-data
```

This is the fastest way to see whether a request from `hf upload`/`hf
download` (or anything else) actually reached the server, and what it did
once it got there — see [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md)'s "How these
were found" section for how this was used to track down real bugs.
`DEBUG=1 ./bin/xet-proxyd ...` does the same for the proxy — useful for
telling whether a slow/failed request actually reached the real
huggingface.co or was served from cache. `xet` (the CLI client) has no
`DEBUG` flag: it's a one-shot command that already prints its result
directly, not a long-running server with request traffic to log.

### `hf upload`/`hf download` hangs or times out
If you're in a sandboxed/corporate network that proxies all outbound
traffic (including `localhost`), `hf_xet`'s Rust HTTP client may not
consistently honor `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` for localhost, and the upload call
hangs. This is an environment limitation, not a xetd bug — the identical
upload/download flow works when driven directly against the CAS server via
`hf_xet`'s low-level Python API. Try setting
`NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1` / `no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1`, or run
outside the proxied environment. `integration-tests/hf_cli_roundtrip.sh`
enforces a timeout so this fails visibly instead of hanging the test suite.

### Integration tests fail to start the server
The runner picks ports `18420`/`18421` by default to avoid colliding with a
`make run`-style instance on `8420`/`8421`. Override with
`XETD_PORT=<port> XETD_HUB_PORT=<port> make integration-test` if those are
also taken.

### `make integration-test` reports "Operation not permitted" creating temp files
The runner uses `$TMPDIR` (or `/tmp` if unset) for all scratch state. Make
sure your environment allows writes there.

### Chunk counts differ between two very similar files more than expected (Xet Data API only)
The Xet Data API's chunker targets an average chunk size of 64 KiB; edits
smaller than that still land inside one chunk boundary, and byte-level
insertions can shift downstream boundaries until the rolling hash
resynchronizes. Expected content-defined-chunking behavior, not a bug.

# Acknowledgments & Related Projects

This project only exists because of work other people published openly.
Thank you to:

- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) and the **Xet** team for
  designing and documenting [the Xet protocol](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/xet/index)
  this project reimplements, and for
  [xet-core](https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core) (the real Rust
  implementation this project is wire-compatible with) — the ultimate
  source of truth every byte here was checked against.
- [jedisct1](https://github.com/jedisct1) for
  [zig-xet](https://github.com/jedisct1/zig-xet), an independent
  third-party reference implementation used to verify this project's own
  `ByteGrouping4` codec against a second, unrelated source rather than
  trusting a single implementation.
- [zeebo](https://github.com/zeebo) for
  [`blake3`](https://github.com/zeebo/blake3), the one external Go
  dependency this project takes on for its main module — a correct,
  well-tested BLAKE3 implementation is exactly the kind of primitive
  worth depending on rather than reimplementing (see
  [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) for why).
- The [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) project,
  whose static assets (vendored under `third_party/swagger-ui-dist`,
  Apache-2.0 — see its own `VENDORED.md`) power this project's fully
  offline `/api-docs/` UI.
- [yuin/goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark),
  [alecthomas/chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma), and
  [abhg/goldmark-mermaid](https://github.com/abhg/goldmark-mermaid),
  which render this repo's own Markdown docs (`scripts/build_docs.go`,
  its own module so these never touch the main `xet-server` module's
  dependency graph).
- The [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) project, for defining the large-file
  Git workflow that Xet's chunking/dedup model improves on — and for
  being the widely-understood baseline this README's
  [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md#why-not-just-put-model-files-in-s3-or-any-plain-http-file-host-instead-of-building-all-this)
  compares against.
- Everyone who publishes public specs (LZ4, AWS Signature Version 4,
  OpenAPI 3.0) clearly enough that a from-scratch, independently-verified
  implementation is actually possible without access to any reference
  server's source code.
