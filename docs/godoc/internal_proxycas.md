package proxycas // import "github.com/guilt/xet-server/internal/proxycas"

Package proxycas implements the CAS-facing side of a caching pull-through proxy
for the real Xet CAS backend, by EMBEDDING a real internal/casserver.Server
as its serving engine rather than reimplementing byte-range serving,
reconstruction-response building, footer/shard indexing, or snapshotting
independently - every one of those already exists, is already tested, and this
package's whole job is to keep it filled with data fetched from upstream,
not to grow a second copy of the same logic that has to be kept in sync by hand.

For each request, this package's job is: check whether the embedded
Server already has what's needed (via its Has*/Ingest* API - see
casserver.Server's own doc comments on IngestXorb/IngestShard/
IngestFileRecon/HasXorbFooter/HasXorbBytes/HasFileRecon); if so, delegate
straight to embedded.ServeHTTP with no upstream call at all - this is what makes
anything already cached fully offline-capable. On a miss, fetch the missing
piece from upstream (via internal/hfclient's CASClient, discovered per-repo
through internal/proxyhub's own xet-token handling - see WithCASClient), feed it
into the embedded Server through Ingest*, then delegate.

Reconstruction is the one place this needs real care: real production Xet's
fetch_info/xorbs URLs are presigned URLs pointing directly at blob storage, not
at the CAS server itself - casserver's own xorbFetchURL always returns its own
byte-serving endpoint (it has no notion of a presigned upstream URL), so simply
feeding an upstream reconstruction's raw xorb hashes into IngestFileRecon and
then delegating to embedded.ServeHTTP is already correct: the embedded server's
own reconstruction handler emits URLs pointing at ITSELF, which is exactly the
rewriting proxycas needs, for free. The one upstream Range-header subtlety
still applies here (see ensureFileReconCached's doc comment): a ranged upstream
response only contains that window's terms, so the FIRST fetch for a file must
always be for the whole thing, regardless of what the downstream caller actually
asked for - IngestFileRecon assumes a complete list.

-no-cache disables all of the above: every request is relayed live to upstream
via internal/hfclient directly, embedded is never touched.

FUNCTIONS

func WithCASClient(ctx context.Context, casClient *hfclient.CASClient) context.Context
    WithCASClient returns a copy of ctx carrying casClient, for handlers in
    this package to read via casClientFromContext. internal/proxyhub calls this
    (after resolving the repo's CAS endpoint via a Hub xet-token request) before
    forwarding a request into this server's ServeHTTP.

func WithTokenRefresher(ctx context.Context, refresher TokenRefresher) context.Context
    WithTokenRefresher returns a copy of ctx carrying refresher, for handlers in
    this package to read via tokenRefresherFromContext.


TYPES

type Server struct {
	// Embedded is the real serving engine - exported so a caller (e.g.
	// cmd/xet-proxyd) can call its own Snapshot/LoadSnapshot directly;
	// this package never needs its own snapshot format, since it has no
	// state of its own beyond what Embedded already tracks.
	Embedded *casserver.Server

	// NoCache disables all caching (the -no-cache flag's effect): every
	// request is relayed live to upstream via internal/hfclient, and
	// Embedded is never read or written. Off by default.
	NoCache bool

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Server wraps an embedded *casserver.Server, filling it from upstream on
    demand. See the package doc comment for the overall design.

func New(xorbs storage.Store) *Server
    New creates a Server backed by xorbs for the embedded casserver.Server's
    local storage.

func (s *Server) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)

func (s *Server) SetAuthenticator(a auth.Authenticator)
    SetAuthenticator gates this package's own handlers (see authenticator's doc
    comment on why this package needs its own copy) AND forwards to the embedded
    casserver.Server, so casserver's own scope checks - the ones that actually
    run once a request is delegated - stay in sync.

func (s *Server) SetRateLimiter(l *ratelimit.Limiter)
    SetRateLimiter installs a per-source-IP rate limiter in front of EVERY route
    this package serves (see rateLimiter's doc comment on why that's broader
    than casserver.Server.SetUploadRateLimiter's upload-only scope). Unlike
    casserver's own SetUploadRateLimiter, this never rebuilds the mux - gate
    reads s.rateLimiter fresh on every request, so a later call takes effect
    immediately, matching this package's own SetAuthenticator/requireScope
    contract exactly. Does NOT forward to Embedded: casserver's own upload
    rate limiter is a distinct, narrower concern (guarding its own local
    CPU cost) that a caller wanting both should configure separately via
    s.Embedded.SetUploadRateLimiter.

type TokenRefresher interface {
	FreshXetTokenFor(ctx context.Context, presentedToken string) (freshToken string, ok bool)
}
    TokenRefresher mints a fresh replacement for an upstream xet access
    token the real CAS rejected. Implemented by internal/proxyhub.Server
    (FreshXetTokenFor) and installed into the request context by
    cmd/xet-proxyd's withUpstreamCASClient middleware; proxycas itself never
    constructs one, and never heals a 401 when none is wired in.
