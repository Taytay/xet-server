// Command xet-proxyd runs a caching pull-through proxy in front of the
// real huggingface.co Hub + CAS APIs - not merely a performance cache,
// but an offline-resilience layer: any repo metadata or xorb bytes this
// proxy has successfully served once keep being servable via `hf
// download`/`hf upload` even after huggingface.co becomes completely
// unreachable. See internal/proxycas and internal/proxyhub's package
// doc comments for the full design.
//
// Two ports, mirroring how the real Hub and CAS are actually separate
// services (the same split cmd/xetd itself makes between -addr and
// -hub-addr): -addr serves the CAS-facing proxy (internal/proxycas),
// -hub-addr serves the Hub-facing proxy (internal/proxyhub). Point
// HF_ENDPOINT at the Hub-facing port and the real `hf` CLI works
// end-to-end through this proxy with no other configuration - exactly
// like pointing it at a local xetd, except every request that can't be
// served from cache is relayed to the real huggingface.co instead of
// this being the only copy of the data.
//
// The CAS-facing proxy has no fixed upstream CAS URL of its own (see
// internal/hfclient's package doc comment on why real Xet CAS's base URL
// is discovered per-repo, not configured): it learns the real upstream
// CAS base URL as a side effect of the Hub-facing proxy relaying
// xet-token calls (internal/proxyhub.Server.UpstreamCASBaseURL). This
// means the Hub-facing proxy must actually see live traffic (at least
// once) before the CAS-facing proxy can serve anything it doesn't
// already have cached - running with -hub-addr disabled limits this
// proxy to whatever xorbs a previous run already learned a CAS URL for
// and cached (see -data's snapshot).
