// ingest.go defines the API a caller embedding this Server as a caching
// layer (internal/proxyhub, wrapping this server instead of rebuilding
// its repoState/revisionState model independently) uses to record a
// repo/revision/file it learned about from an upstream Hub response,
// exactly as if a real client had committed it through the normal write
// path (handleCommit/handleCreateBranch) — so a caching proxy sitting in
// front of the real huggingface.co and this Server end up with identical
// state for anything the proxy has touched, and a plain xetd pointed at
// the same -data directory afterward serves it with zero migration step.
// See internal/casserver's own IngestXorb/IngestShard for the CAS-side
// counterpart to this pattern.
